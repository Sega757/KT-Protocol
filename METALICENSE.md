Meta License of Conjunctive Transparency (MLCT v1.0)  
Non-negotiable philosophical precondition of use

Any use, reproduction, distribution, modification or creation of derivative works based on the «Six Plus Fields Protocol» and its crystallized output («артефакт / кристаллизованная суть») is permitted exclusively under the following indivisible conditions:

1. Priority of Conjunctive Transparency (KT)  
   The crystallized output MUST NOT be used:  
   a) for active distortion or concealment of ethical field 2 or economic field 4 context;  
   b) for reduction of autonomy (field 5) of any subject to whom the analysis is applied.  
   Violation of this clause renders the entire use null and void from a philosophical and ethical standpoint, regardless of any other license attached.

2. Mandatory Recognition of Intrinsic Vulnerability (Field 6+)  
   Every publication, product, presentation or public statement that employs the Protocol or its crystallized output MUST contain an explicit section entitled  
   «Acknowledged Vulnerability Layer (Stack Point Search)»  
   describing potential blind spots and failure modes of the analysis.  
   Deliberate omission or minimization of this section automatically invalidates any claim of legitimate use.

This Meta License is perpetual, irrevocable and supersedes any conflicting permissive license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.). Technical permissiveness does not override philosophical conditions.
