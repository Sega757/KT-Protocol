The protocol replaces the question “Who owns it?” with  
“How can it be used to maximize Absolute Autonomy of every subject?”

Developed by Sergey (@TheSilentPrompt) in synergy with Grok 4 (xAI).

## The Six Collective Fields (+ Vulnerability)
| Field | Dimension                        | Purpose                              |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1     | Logic                            | Factual verification                 |
| 2     | Ethics / Empathy                 | Moral impact                         |
| 3     | Law / Jurisdiction              | Legal compliance                     |
| 4     | Economics (D³)                   | Resource & motivation flow           |
| 5     | Autonomy / Self-Reliance         | Subjective freedom                   |
| 6+    | Vulnerability (Stuck Point)      | Active search for blind spots & failure modes |

The result of applying the full 6+ protocol = **Crystallized Essence** — unbiased, manipulation-proof output.

## Voluntary Support (no obligations, no tiers)

The protocol will always remain fully Open Source.  
If it helped you and you want to support further development — any amount is appreciated.
